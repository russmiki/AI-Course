Telegram AI Image Generator Bot

Implementation using n8n and Hugging Face API


1. Project Overview

This project implements an AI-based Telegram bot capable of generating images from textual prompts using a machine learning image generation model.
The system is developed using n8n workflow automation and integrates external AI services through RESTful APIs.

Users interact with the system via Telegram by sending a text prompt. The bot processes the request, sends it to an image generation API, and returns the generated image to the user.

5. Project Objectives 

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
• To gain hands-on experience with workflow automation platforms, specifically n8n
• To understand how AI-based services can be integrated into real-world applications using RESTful APIs
• To design and deploy a fully functional Telegram bot capable of responding to user requests
• To explore end-to-end AI service pipelines, from user input to AI inference and final output delivery
• To minimize traditional coding by leveraging low-code / no-code automation tools

This project emphasizes practical implementation over theoretical discussion, enabling students to experience how modern AI systems are deployed in production-like environments.

6. System Architecture 

The system is based on an event-driven and modular architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

Workflow Steps:
1. A user sends a text prompt to the Telegram bot
2. Telegram triggers an event that activates the n8n workflow
3. n8n forwards the prompt to the Hugging Face Image Generation API
4. The AI model processes the input and generates an image
5. The generated image is returned as a Base64-encoded string
6. n8n converts the Base64 data into a binary image file
7. The final image is sent back to the user through Telegram

This architecture ensures clear separation of responsibilities between communication, processing, and response delivery.

7. Technologies and Tools 

The following technologies and tools were used in the development of this project:
• n8n – Workflow automation and orchestration
• Telegram Bot API – User interaction and message handling
• Hugging Face Inference API – AI-powered image generation
• HTTP / REST APIs – Communication between services
• Base64 Encoding – Image data transmission and conversion

Each technology was selected to ensure simplicity, reliability, and compatibility with modern AI pipelines.

8. APIs and External Services 

8.1 Telegram Bot API

The Telegram Bot API is responsible for:
• Receiving user text prompts
• Triggering the automation workflow
• Delivering generated images back to users

Telegram provides a lightweight, reliable, and widely used platform for chatbot-based applications.

8.2 Hugging Face Image Generation API
• Provider: Hugging Face
• Model: black-forest-labs/flux-dev
• Task: Text-to-Image Generation
• Response Format: Base64-encoded image

This API enables access to state-of-the-art image generation models without the need for local GPU resources.

9. n8n Workflow Description
    
The n8n workflow consists of a sequence of well-defined nodes:

Telegram Trigger
        ↓
HTTP Request (Image Generation API)
        ↓
Base64 to Binary Conversion
        ↓
Telegram Send Photo

Each node performs a single responsibility, which improves:
• Readability
• Debugging
• Maintainability
• Future extensibility

This modular design allows new features to be added with minimal changes to existing components.

11. Sample Results

11.1 Generated Image Examples

Sample images generated by the system are stored in the images/ directory.
These results demonstrate the system’s ability to:
• Interpret natural language prompts
• Generate visually coherent images
• Deliver outputs in near real-time

The quality of generated images depends on the AI model and the specificity of the user prompt.

12. Installation and Execution Guide 

12.1 Prerequisites
• Installed n8n
 • A valid Telegram Bot Token (created via BotFather)
 • A Hugging Face API Token

12.2 Setup Steps
 1. Start n8n:

n8n start

 2. Import the workflow file:

 • Import n8n_telegram_image.json into the n8n dashboard

 3. Configure credentials:

 • Set Telegram Bot Token
 • Set Hugging Face API Token

 4. Activate the workflow

⸻

12.3 Running the Bot
 1. Open Telegram
 2. Send a text prompt to the bot
 3. Receive the generated image as a response

The entire process is automated and requires no manual intervention after setup.

⸻

13. Security Considerations 
 • API tokens must never be committed to public repositories
 • Credentials are securely managed using n8n’s credential system or environment variables
 • Access to sensitive configuration data is restricted to authorized users only

These measures help prevent unauthorized access and data leakage.

⸻

14. Testing and Evaluation

The system was evaluated using multiple test cases:
 • Various text prompts with different levels of complexity
 • Response time measurement
 • Verification of image quality and consistency
 • Stability testing under repeated requests

The workflow demonstrated stable performance and consistent output quality.

⸻

15. Project Outcomes
 • Successful deployment of an AI-powered image generation pipeline
 • Seamless interaction between Telegram, n8n, and Hugging Face
 • Fully automated system with minimal manual configuration
 • Improved understanding of real-world AI service integration

⸻

16. Limitations

⚠️ Free Trial Limitation Notice

This project relies on third-party services that offer limited free-tier access. Therefore:
 • The system may be available only for a limited duration
 • Image generation may stop once the free quota is exceeded
 • These limitations depend entirely on external service providers

The developers have no control over these constraints.

⸻

17. Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions include:
 • Support for image size, style, and resolution selection
 • User request logging and analytics
 • Database integration for image storage and retrieval
 • Enhanced user interaction and command-based controls
 • Error handling and fallback mechanisms
