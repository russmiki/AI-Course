## 🌱 Project Overview

NexMind is an AI-powered conversational system designed as a digital mental health assistant.  
The system focuses on emotional awareness, empathetic dialogue, and supportive interaction 💬💛.

The system does not provide medical diagnosis, therapy, or clinical treatment.  
Its purpose is to encourage emotional expression, reflection, and general well-being support in a non-clinical and ethical manner.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design and implement an AI-based conversational assistant  
- Detect emotional signals from user input  
- Apply a multi-agent decision-making architecture  
- Combine rule-based responses with AI-generated responses  
- Develop a full-stack system with clear separation of concerns  
- Follow ethical and safety-aware AI design principles ⚖️  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project follows a three-tier architecture:

1. Frontend (Client Side)  
2. Backend (Server Side)  
3. AI Logic Layer  

---

### 💻 Frontend (Client Side)

- Implemented using React
- Provides a chat-based user interface
- Handles user input and message visualization
- Communicates with the backend via HTTP requests
- Supports both Persian (RTL) and English (LTR) text direction 🌍

---

### ⚙️ Backend (Server Side)

- Implemented using FastAPI
- Exposes a RESTful API endpoint (/generate)
- Handles request validation and response formatting
- Acts as an interface between frontend and AI logic
- Manages CORS configuration for cross-origin communication 🔗

---

### 🤖 AI Logic Layer

- Implemented in Python
- Uses a multi-agent architecture
- Maintains limited conversation memory
- Applies safety checks and ethical constraints
- Decides between rule-based and AI-generated responses

---

## 🧩 Multi-Agent Design

The AI logic consists of multiple specialized agents:

Emotion Analyzer Agent  
Detects emotional keywords from user input using a transparent rule-based approach 😊😟😡  

Confidence Agent  
Estimates the confidence level of detected emotions 📊  

Strategy Agent  
Decides whether to use rule-based responses or AI-generated responses 🧠  

Safety Agent  
Detects potentially harmful or sensitive content and ensures safe responses 🚨  

Affection and Name Detection Agent  
Adjusts tone and response style when the assistant is directly addressed 💬💖  

---

## 🌐 AI Model and API Usage

The project integrates a Language Model API to generate dynamic responses when rule-based logic is insufficient.

Reasons for using a Language Model API:
- Natural and context-aware response generation  
- Ability to handle open-ended emotional expressions  
- Improved conversational flexibility  
- Effective integration with multi-agent systems  

Rule-based responses are prioritized when emotional confidence is high,  
while AI-generated responses are used as a fallback mechanism.
